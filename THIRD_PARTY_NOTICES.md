# Third-party components

The WDA runtime fetches Appium WebDriverAgent 16.14.0 at commit
`d17782422d55ff1e5e0ceb74eb1fd509cc0c35b6` from
https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent. WDA is BSD licensed; its original
LICENSE stays in the external checkout. WDA source, builds and signing data
are not bundled into this plugin.

USB forwarding uses appium-ios-device 3.1.24 under Apache-2.0, installed via
tooling/package-lock.json. The dependency's license remains in node_modules,
as do the licenses of its transitive dependencies. The Python MCP server uses
only the Python standard library.

## Screen panel and retired widget stack

The live screen is the DSH right-Sidebar panel shipped as `client.js` in the
DSH plugin package. It builds on the host's own client module system and the
React external the shell provides, is our own screen and toolbar
implementation, and bundles no browser dependency and no OpenAI artwork or
authorship claim.

Earlier releases previewed the screen inside the host through a
self-contained `assets/phone-screen.html` built from `ui/` on top of the
pinned `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` 1.7.5 SDK. That widget stack (`ui/`,
`assets/phone-screen.html` and `scripts/check_screen_ui.py`) retired together
with the host it served, so the licenses pasted here for it no longer cover
anything this repository ships. The panel ships no bundled browser
dependency, so no additional notice is required for it.
